Hi, I was using a mac while working on this assignment. I got aspectj working on my computer and ajc but tried many commands to compile it from the terminal and was not able to get anything working. I developed using eclipse and I was able to run with the aspectj compiler in it.
I the FILES Folder contains my .java and .ajc files in the ECLIPSE folder I included my eclipse project.

My reusable Logging module is composed into an ILoggable Interface that specifies the log function. A Loggable abstract aspectj file that contains the definition of the log function. And the composition specification that requires a declaration for the classes to implement the ILoggable interface. To customize a user must include the "declare parents : myClass implements ILoggable" and specify the class that will be giving the loggable functionality. And when specify the pointcuts must include ILoggable as an argument which allows access to the log function (l.log()) in order to log a message.
